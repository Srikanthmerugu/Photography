A responsive website for a study abroad consultancy that provides information about various services like Overseas Study, Photography & Video Editing, Security Guards, Contact, and About Us sections. The website is designed using **React.js** and **CSS** with responsive behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Dropdown Menu with Arrow**: The dropdown menu for "Overseas Study" includes an animated arrow to visually indicate its presence.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The website adapts to different screen sizes, and the navigation menu auto-closes when a nav item is selected on smaller screens.
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth animations for hover effects, including underlines that expand from the center of the nav items.

## Tech Stack
